# Imagine you have a credit card with a free air miles bonus program (or maybe 
# you already have one). As a user, you are expected to input the amount of 
# money you spend on average from this card per month. Let's assume that the 
# bonus program gives you 2 free air miles for every dollar you spend. Here's a 
# simple program to figure out when you can travel somewhere for free:

# card_expense = int(input())
# bonus_miles = card_expense * 2

# Naturally, similar assignment forms exist for the rest of arithmetic operations: 
# -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=. Given the opportunity, use them to save time and effort.

# n = 435
# last_n = n % 10
# print(last_n)
found = "ar"
word = "komar"
print(''.join(i if i in found else "-" for i in word))


# print(set(word))
